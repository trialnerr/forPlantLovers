# Plant Identifier App

An app where you can identify plant types, and save them to a personal gallery. 

## Features

- Upload photos and get identification estimates, with confidence levels, of what the plant could be!
- Add identified plants to a personal gallery. 

## How It's Made

This app is built using a Node.js backend and a React frontend. The backend handles image processing and plant identification. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for uploading photos and viewing identified plants.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Typescript. 
Backend: NodeJs, Cloudinary, MongoDB. 

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me about the intricacies of authenticating a React App. This being my first time working with Typescript to build a full stack application, I learnt a lot, through endless debugging, about Typescript configuration and best practices. I have deepened my understanding of Javascript. 

## Getting Started

1. Start the backend server:
  ```bash
  cd server 
  npm i
  npm run dev
  ```
2. Start the frontend server:
  ```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
  ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
